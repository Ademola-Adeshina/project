# project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the Microsoft Excel, My SQL to make the analysis easier. This data set contains of two different sheet (The 'tmbd_5000_credits' and 'tmbd_5000_movies) containing information about 4,800 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user budget and revenue Certain columns, like ‘cast’, 'crew and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (:) characters. The two columns budget and revenue shows the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time
